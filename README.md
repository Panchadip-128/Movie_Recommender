MOVIE RECOMMENDATION MODEL:
---------------------------

This repository contains a movie recommendation model built using cosine-similarity
The goal of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie features.

FEATURES:
---------

Data Preprocessing: Extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the movie dataset for model training.
Feature Engineering: Various features such as 'genre', 'cast', 'crew', and 'keywords' are extracted and engineered to improve recommendation accuracy.
Model Training: The model is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of user movie ratings and movie features.
Recommendation Generation: Once trained, the model can generate personalized movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.

USAGE:
------

Data Collection: Gather movie data from reliable sources or datasets available online.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as genre, cast, crew, and keywords from the movie dataset.
Model Training: Train the classification model using the preprocessed dataset.
Recommendation Generation: Use the trained model to generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.
